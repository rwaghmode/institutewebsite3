                        <p>Fellow Dreamer, First of all, I would like to congratulate you on taking the first step towards achieving your dream. We all have different dreams and this is what makes us unique.

                           Let me explain the vision behind Ethan’s Tech. I started Ethan’s Tech to fulfill my dream of imparting quality training to my professionals. I have also dreamed of myself as a trainer by passion, a Python programmer and Data Scientist by skill, and a lifelong student by outlook. During the course of my professional career, I realized the significant gap between the academic content taught in schools and colleges, and its practical usage in actual industrial scenarios. This academia-industry mismatch has made people get stuck in a career/technology/job, which they either do not enjoy or are not skilled at. Based on these problem statements, I decided to start Ethan’s Tech as a training institute where the primary aim is improving and niche technical skills to professionals and students. Our focus is to ensure that the student develops a thorough understanding of the technology, so that one enjoys her job. If you find a job you love, you will never work again. This led us to develop our technical courses from scratch, wherein the student was made the center of our project. The idea was to breakdown the concepts in such a manner that everyone is able to understand them, and a live practice of these concepts so as to enforce understanding of these concepts. This was not an easy task. We had to take feedback from our students after every class, and redesign our teaching methodology so that everyone is able to understand the projects. The selection of practical examples was a challenging task because they have to clear the concept and develop an understanding of real-life industry use cases. The major and minor projects are carefully selected to ensure that our students have some basic understanding when they start their career.</p>
